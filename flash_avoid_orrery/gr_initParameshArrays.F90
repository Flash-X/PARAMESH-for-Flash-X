!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Perform early initialization of some Grid data structures.
!!
!!  This routine prepares the Grid for being filled with
!!  meaningful data.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!   restart -   Is the grid being prepared for initialization with
!!               data from a checkpoint file?
!!   xlboundary - boundary condition type of outer domain boundary in lower X direction.
!!   xrboundary - boundary condition type of outer domain boundary in upper X direction.
!!   ylboundary - boundary condition type of outer domain boundary in lower Y direction.
!!   yrboundary - boundary condition type of outer domain boundary in upper Y direction.
!!   zlboundary - boundary condition type of outer domain boundary in lower Z direction.
!!   zrboundary - boundary condition type of outer domain boundary in upper Z direction.
