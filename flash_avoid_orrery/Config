PPDEFINE FLASH_GRID_PARAMESH4DEV_SURR_BLKS_OPTION

D use_flash_surr_blks_fill  Whether to use FLASH's custom
D & surr_blks fill rather than the default pm4dev orrery algorithm
D & for surr_blks fill.  It is expected that the custom
D & implementation will be faster, although it is less widely
D & applicable.  It will be ignored if the custom implementation
D & is not applicable, and the orrery will be used.  As such, setting
D & to .true. as a default value is not dangerous.
PARAMETER use_flash_surr_blks_fill BOOLEAN TRUE

D use_reduced_orrery  If the orrery needs to be run it is
D & useful to circulate the data in a reduced communicator
D & containing only those MPI ranks that own Paramesh blocks.
PARAMETER use_reduced_orrery BOOLEAN TRUE
