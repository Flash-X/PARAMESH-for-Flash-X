!! NAME
!!
!!   find_surrblks
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!   Call find_surrblks()
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!! INCLUDES
!!
!!   paramesh_preprocessor.fh
!!   mpif.h
!!
!! USES
!!
!!   local_tree_common
!!
!! CALLS
!!
!!   free_local_tree
!!   local_tree_build
!!   tree_search_for_surrblks
!!
!! RETURNS
!!
!!   Does not return anything.  Upon exit a local tree has been created on
!!   each processor and the 'surr_blks' has been filled.
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!   This routine finds the surrounding blocks at the same refinement level
!!   of all blocks.  It does this by first constucting a local tree on each 
!!   processor which represents the entire domain.  This local tree is then 
!!   searched by the list of local blocks to construct the surrounding block
!!   list.
