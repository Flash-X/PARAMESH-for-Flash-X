!! NAME
!!
!!   amr_restrict_unk_dg
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!   Call amr_restrict_unk_dg (datain, dataout, ivar, ioff, joff, koff)
!!   Call amr_restrict_unk_dg (real array, real array, integer, integer, integer, integer)
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!   Real,    Intent(in)    :: datain(:,:,:,:)  data to restrict
!!   Real,    Intent(inout) :: dataout(:,:,:,:)  data which is restricted and returned
!!   Integer, Intent(in)    :: ivar  variable number in unk to restrict
!!   ioff, joff, koff : offsets of the restricted data that is returned within the coarse
!!                      block; each of these numbers should be either 0 or half
!!                      the number of interior cells in the block for the
!!                      relevant direction.
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!   This routine performs interpolation for the restriction operation on
!!   DG quadrature-point data stored in 'unk'.
!!
!!   Data is passed in in the array 'datain' and returned in the array
!!   'dataout'.
!!   The last argument 'ivar' specifies which variable in 'unk' to apply
!!   the interpolation to.
!!
!!  This is a stub that needs to be overridden to be useful.
!!
!!  This stub version just aborts with a message.
