!! NAME
!!
!!   mpi_amr_local_surr_blks_lkup
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!   call mpi_amr_local_surr_blks_lkup(mype, lb, 
!!                                     surrblks, l_parent, psurrblks)
!!
!!   call mpi_amr_local_surr_blks_lkup(integer, integer, 
!!                                     integer, logical, integer)
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!   
!!   integer, intent(in) :: mype  
!!     The calling processor.
!!
!!   integer, intent(in) :: lb
!!     Block for which neighboring blocks are to be found.
!!
!!   integer, intent(out) :: surrblks(:,:,:,:)
!!     List of the surrounding blocks which is returned.
!!
!!   logical, intent(in) :: l_parent
!!     Logical flag which indicates if parents of surrounding blocks are
!!     also to be found and returned.
!!   
!!   integer, intent(in) :: psurrblks
!!     The list of the surrounding blocks of the parent of block 'lb'.
!!
!! INCLUDES
!!
!!   paramesh_preprocessor.fh
!!   mpif.h
!!
!! USES
!! 
!!   paramesh_dimensions
!!   physicaldata
!!   tree
!!   mpi_morton
!!
!! CALLS
!! 
!!   No other Paramesh routines are called
!!    
!! RETURNS
!!
!!   A list of the surrounding blocks of a block 'lb' on the local processor in the
!!   array 'surrblks' and also a list of the surrounding blocks of its parent block in
!!   the arrays 'psurrblks'.
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!   This routine finds the addresses of surrounding blocks of the block lb
!!   on the local processor, and optionally also of its parent block, from
!!   the metainformation array surr_blks that is maintained by PARAMESH.
!!   This routine finds these block addresses by searching the list of
!!   off-processor blocks which have previously been communicated.
