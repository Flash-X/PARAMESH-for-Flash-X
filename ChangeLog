	* headers/paramesh_dimensions.F90: introduce 'include
	"gr_pmPdgDimenInit.fh"' for initializing PARAMESH constants
	hardwired for several physicaldata groups. This relies on support
	of the Flash-X configuration mechanism (setup.py) for generating
	the file to included (and other files included by THAT file).

	processing loop if we are dealing with ancillary restriction.
