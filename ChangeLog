	* source/mpi_amr_1blk_restrict.F90: request data for restriction
	also into ANCESTOR blocks, if the ancestor data could potentially
	be needed for purposes of (de)refinement criteria. Such a
	potential need is assumed if the ANCESTOR has at least one
	same-level neighbor of type 2 (PARENT) and the ANCESTOR's
	refinement level is not below lrefine_min.
