SUMMMARY

This directory contains scripts which edit the PARAMESH source code
and reorder the indeces of the arrays used by PARAMESH.  This script
was written to give users the opportunity to get better performance on
different processor architectures.  The script was written by
Ganapathy Murali Krishnan while he was working for the FLASH center at
the University of Chicago.  Kevin Olson made it work with the entire
PARAMESH package by altering some of the PARAMESH source code.


WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES

Normally the array 'unk' in PARAMESH is allocated:

unk(nvar,il_bnd,ju_bnd,ku_bnd,maxblocks)

When you run the reorder script the ordering will become

unk(il_bnd,ju_bnd,ku_bnd,nvar,maxblocks)

Also, the reordering is done for ALL the different arrays you might
want to access such as:

facevarx, facevary, facevarz, unk_e_x, unk_e_y, unk_e_z, and unk_n.

Running the script a second time produces an ordering:

unk(ju_bnd,ku_bnd,nvar,iu_bnd,maxblocks)

The script can be run multiple times to produce different orderings.


USAGE

To run the script type:

./reorder 

from inside this directory.  It will produce a lot of output.  Ignore it.

NOTE1: You should clean and recompile PARAMESH after using the script.

NOTE2: You will need to modify any code you have written which
accesses the PARAMESH arrays mentioned above and take into account the
new ordering of the array indeces.
