Auxiliary files moved inside the PM_package level, primarily
for use by Incompressible-Navier-Stokes solver in Flash-X.
Should work together with a higher-level "Incomp" directory.
Source files here are used in place of files with
the same name at higher directory levels if and
only if this source directory is REQUIRED
or REQUESTED.
