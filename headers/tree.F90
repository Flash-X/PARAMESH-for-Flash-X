!! NAME
!!
!!   physicaldata
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!   Module tree
!!
!! INCLUDES
!!
!!   paramesh_preprocessor.fh
!!
!! USES
!!
!!   paramesh_dimensions
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!   Fortran 90 Module which 'holds' the tree data which PARAMESH uses
!!   for a quad or oct-tree data structure, implemented on a parallel computer.
!!   This data includes information such which blocks are neighbors of other 
!!   blocks, which block is another block's parent, and which blocks are child 
!!   blocks of a particular block.
!!
!!   A convention is established for numbering the neighbors (or faces
!!   of a block. The first neighbor is at lower x coordinate, the 
!!   second at higher x, the third at lower y, fourth at higher y, fifth
!!   at lower z and the sixth at higher z.
!!
!!   The convention by which the children of a block are numbered is the
!!   same as the fortran array ordering, so that the first child is
!!   at lower x, y and z coordinate, the second child is at upper x
!!   but lower y and z, the third is at lower x, upper y and lower z,
!!   and so on.
!!
!!   When a block has a refined neighbor we will need to know which children
!!   of this neighbor are to provide guard cell information. The id's of the
!!   correct children are stored in kchild using the conventions described 
!!   above. For example, if we are working on the 3rd neighbor of the
!!   current block and it is at finer refinement level, then we must access
!!   the children designated by kchild(:,3), in this case children 1, 2, 5
!!   and 6.
!!
!!   The tree organizes a set of up to maxblocks_tr grids on each processor.
!!   All the grids are assumed to be cartesian with a uniform size. Each 
!!   grid has a level of refinement associated with it. The set of level 0
!!   grids cover the computational domain without overlap. Each grid
!!   can be the parent of 2**d offspring grids which completely cover 
!!   the sub-domain of their parents, where d is the physical dimension
!!   of the simulation. The linear resolution varies by a factor of 2 
!!   between successive levels of refinement. At no point do we allow the
!!   resolution to jump by more than one level of refinement.
